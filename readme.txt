script to batch recolor sprites with the dk pallete

install python to run

colourswapper.py is the file you want to run, not the png lib

includes sample of a recolored knight

the in folder should have all images you want to recolor

output will be placed in out folder

mask folder is for when only part of the image needs recoloring, in sample the knight gets recolored without also recouloring the torture table

pal_in.png should just stay the same,

pal_out.png should be modified to the new colours you want in the output
